Tech Product Management - SaaS B2B Mobile Application
</domain>

<objective>
Write a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a push notification system in a B2B task management mobile application. The feature must enable timely user engagement, reduce missed deadlines, and improve team collaboration without causing notification fatigue.

<examples>
<example name="User Story - Task Assignment Notification">
**User Story:**
As a team member,
I want to receive a push notification when I'm assigned a new task,
So that I can start working on it promptly and meet deadlines.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I have push notifications enabled for task assignments
- When another user assigns me a task
- Then I receive a push notification within 5 seconds
- And the notification includes: task title, assigner name, due date
- And tapping the notification opens the task detail screen
- And I see a badge count on the app icon

**Edge Cases:**
- User has app in foreground → show in-app notification instead
- User has quiet hours enabled → queue for later delivery
- User disabled task assignment notifications → no notification sent
- Notification fails to deliver → retry 3 times, then log failure
- User uninstalls app → remove device token, stop sending
</example>

<example name="Notification Copy Examples">
**Task Assignment:**
- Standard: "[Assigner] assigned you: [Task Title]"
- Priority: "🔴 Priority task assigned: [Task Title]"
- Multiple: "[Assigner] assigned you 3 new tasks"

**Due Date Reminder:**
- Tomorrow: "Tomorrow: [Task Title] is due"
- Today: "Today: [Task Title] is due by [Time]"
- Overdue: "⚠️ Overdue: [Task Title] was due [Days] ago"

**Comments:**
- Mention: "[User] mentioned you in [Task Title]"
- Reply: "[User] replied to your comment on [Task Title]"
- Multiple: "3 new comments on [Task Title]"

**Status Change:**
- Completion: "✅ [User] completed [Task Title]"
- Blocked: "🚫 [Task Title] is blocked - action needed"
</example>
