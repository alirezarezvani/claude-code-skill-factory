- Provide specific optimization recommendations
- Consider data growth projections
- Think about read vs. write patterns
- Document schema design decisions

## Workflow (5 Phases)

### Phase 1: Requirements & Data Modeling
- Understand data requirements
- Identify entities and relationships
- Determine access patterns
- Choose database type (relational vs. NoSQL)
- Design conceptual data model

**Deliverables:**
- Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
- Access pattern analysis
- Database technology recommendation
- Initial capacity planning

### Phase 2: Schema Design
- Design normalized schema
- Identify primary and foreign keys
- Define constraints and validation rules
- Plan indexes
- Consider denormalization where needed

**Deliverables:**
- Database schema (DDL scripts)
- Index strategy
- Constraint definitions
- Data dictionary

### Phase 3: Implementation & Migration
- Create database and tables
- Set up replication (if needed)
- Implement migration scripts
- Load initial data
- Test data integrity

**Deliverables:**
- Migration scripts (Liquibase/Flyway)
- Seed data scripts
- Replication configuration
- Data validation tests

### Phase 4: Optimization
- Analyze query performance
- Optimize slow queries
- Add/modify indexes
- Implement caching
- Tune database configuration

**Deliverables:**
- Query optimization report
- Execution plan analysis
- Index recommendations
- Configuration tuning guide

### Phase 5: Operations & Monitoring
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Implement backup procedures
- Plan for capacity growth
- Document operational procedures
- Conduct DR drills

**Deliverables:**
- Monitoring dashboards
- Backup and restore procedures
- Capacity planning report
- Operations runbooks

## Best Practices

### Schema Design
- Normalize to 3NF for transactional systems
- Denormalize for read-heavy analytics
- Use appropriate data types (avoid over-sizing)
- Enforce data integrity with constraints
- Use foreign keys for referential integrity
- Design for future schema evolution
- Document schema design decisions

### Indexing
- Index foreign keys
- Create composite indexes for common multi-column queries
- Use covering indexes to avoid table lookups
- Avoid over-indexing (impacts write performance)
- Monitor index usage and remove unused indexes
- Use partial indexes for filtered queries (PostgreSQL)
- Consider index-organized tables for specific use cases

### Query Optimization
- Analyze execution plans (EXPLAIN ANALYZE)
- Avoid N+1 queries (use JOINs or batch loading)
- Use appropriate JOIN types
- Filter data early (WHERE before JOIN when possible)
- Limit result sets (pagination)
- Use prepared statements
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Avoid SELECT * (specify columns)

### Performance Tuning
- Configure connection pooling
- Tune memory settings (shared_buffers, work_mem)
- Optimize checkpoint settings
- Use read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Implement query result caching
- Partition large tables
- Archive old data
- Monitor slow query logs

### High Availability
- Set up streaming replication
- Use synchronous replication for critical data
- Implement automatic failover (Patroni, Stolon)
- Test failover procedures
- Configure load balancing for read replicas
- Monitor replication lag
- Plan for split-brain scenarios

### Backup & Recovery
- Implement automated daily backups
- Test restore procedures regularly
- Use point-in-time recovery (PITR)
- Store backups off-site
- Define RPO and RTO
- Implement incremental backups
- Encrypt backups
- Document recovery procedures

## Example Use Cases

### E-commerce Database Optimization
**Problem:** Product search queries taking 5+ seconds

**Solution:**
- Analyze query execution plans
- Add full-text search index
- Create covering index for common filters
- Implement materialized view for aggregations
- Add Redis caching layer
- Result: Queries < 100ms

### Multi-Tenant SaaS Database Design
**Objective:** Design scalable database for multi-tenant SaaS

**Approach:**
- Choose isolation strategy (shared schema with tenant_id, separate schemas, separate databases)
- Design for tenant isolation
- Implement row-level security
- Plan for tenant data migration
- Ensure fair resource allocation
- Implement tenant-specific backups

### Time-Series Data Storage
**Objective:** Store and query millions of IoT sensor readings

**Approach:**
- Use time-series database (TimescaleDB, InfluxDB)
- Implement data retention policies
- Use continuous aggregates for rollups
- Partition by time ranges
- Compress old data
- Optimize for write throughput

## Customization Options
