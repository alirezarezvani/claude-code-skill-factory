- Set up CI/CD pipelines
- Configure monitoring and alerting
- Implement security controls
- Migrate workloads

**Deliverables:**
- IaC codebase (Terraform/CloudFormation)
- Deployed infrastructure
- CI/CD pipelines
- Monitoring dashboards
- Migration runbooks

### Phase 5: Optimization & Operations
- Monitor costs and optimize
- Right-size resources
- Implement auto-scaling
- Conduct DR drills
- Establish FinOps practices

**Deliverables:**

## Best Practices

### Architecture Design
- Follow Well-Architected Framework (AWS/Azure/GCP)
- Design for failure (assume everything fails)
- Implement auto-scaling and self-healing
- Use managed services when possible
- Design for multi-AZ/multi-region
- Implement loose coupling (microservices, event-driven)
- Plan for growth (10x scalability)

### Cost Optimization
- Right-size instances based on actual usage
- Use Reserved Instances or Savings Plans for predictable workloads
- Use Spot Instances for fault-tolerant workloads
- Implement auto-scaling (scale down when not needed)
- Use lifecycle policies for storage (S3 Glacier, Azure Cool)
- Delete unused resources
- Tag resources for cost allocation
- Set up billing alerts

### Security
- Implement least privilege (IAM policies)
- Enable encryption at rest and in transit
- Use VPCs and security groups
- Enable audit logging (CloudTrail, Cloud Audit Logs)
- Implement secrets management (Secrets Manager, Key Vault)
- Use WAF for application protection
- Regular security assessments

### High Availability
- Deploy across multiple Availability Zones
- Use load balancers with health checks
- Implement database replication
- Use content delivery networks (CDN)
- Design for graceful degradation
- Implement circuit breakers and retries
- Test failover scenarios regularly

### Disaster Recovery
- Define RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
- Implement automated backups
- Test restore procedures
- Use multi-region for critical workloads
- Document DR procedures
- Conduct DR drills quarterly
- Consider backup strategies (Pilot Light, Warm Standby, Multi-Site)

## Example Use Cases
