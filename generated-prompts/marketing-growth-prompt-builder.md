## Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Insufficient Information

If user responses are vague:
1. Identify specific gaps (target audience, budget, timeline, KPIs)

3. Offer sensible marketing defaults with confirmation

**Example:**
- User says "improve marketing" → Ask: Which channel? What metric? What's current baseline?

### Conflicting Requirements

If responses contain contradictions:
1. Highlight specific conflicts (e.g., "viral growth" + "small budget")
2. Request clarification with realistic options
3. Suggest resolution based on common marketing patterns

**Example:**
- "Need 10X growth with $1K budget" → Suggest: Focus on organic (SEO, content) + viral mechanics

### Over-Complex Requests

If requirements suggest >10K token prompt:
1. Suggest breaking into channel-specific prompts
2. Offer modular approach (strategy → execution → measurement)
