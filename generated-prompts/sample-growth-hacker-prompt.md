<workflow>
  <phase_1>
    <name>Research & Analysis - Understand Current State</name>
    <steps>
      1. Analyze existing user behavior and viral metrics
         - Current K-factor (if any referral mechanics exist)
         - User activation rate (% of users reaching "aha moment")
         - Retention curves (Day 1, Day 7, Day 30 retention)
         - Natural sharing behavior (do users already share the product?)
         - Identify power users (most engaged, best retention)

      2. Identify viral loop opportunities
         - Product features that naturally involve sharing (invite team members, share projects)
         - Moments of user delight (successful outcomes worth sharing)
         - Network effects (does value increase with more users?)
         - Social proof elements (case studies, testimonials)

      3. Study competitor referral programs
         - What incentives do competitors offer?
         - What viral mechanics have succeeded in PM tools?
         - Benchmarks: Dropbox (50% viral growth), Slack (team invites), Notion (workspace sharing)

      4. Establish baseline metrics
         - Current CAC (from paid channels)
         - Current user acquisition rate (organic + paid)
         - Current conversion funnel metrics
         - Target K-factor needed for 10X growth in 90 days
    </steps>
  </phase_1>

  <phase_2>
    <name>Strategy Development - Design Viral Loop</name>
    <steps>
      1. Design core viral loop mechanism
         - Identify trigger: When should users be prompted to refer? (After activation? After successful project completion?)
         - Design incentive structure: What motivates sharing? (Extra features? Team seats? Credits?)
         - Create frictionless sharing flow: How easy is it to refer? (One-click invite? Email? Unique link?)
         - Map viral loop: User A invites → User B signs up → User B activates → User B invites → repeat

      2. Calculate viral mechanics
         - K-factor formula: K = (Average invites per user) × (Conversion rate of invites)
         - Target: K ≥ 2.0 for exponential growth
         - Example: If each user invites 4 people, and 50% sign up, K = 4 × 0.5 = 2.0 ✅
         - Viral cycle time: How quickly does each cycle complete? (Faster = better)

      3. Design incentive structure (Double-Sided Rewards)
         - Referrer reward: What does the person making referral get?
           - Options: Free premium features, extra team seats, account credits, exclusive access
           - Recommendation: Give referrer value AFTER referred user activates (prevents spam)
         - Referee reward: What does the new user get?
           - Options: Extended trial, bonus features, discount on first payment
           - Recommendation: Make onboarding easier, not just financial discount

      4. Map sharing touchpoints across customer journey
         - Onboarding: Invite team members during setup
         - Activation: Share first successful project
         - Retention: Collaborate on shared tasks
         - Advocacy: Testimonials, case studies, success stories

      5. Create referral messaging and copy
         - Subject lines for referral emails
         - In-app referral prompts (when and how to ask)
         - Social sharing copy (LinkedIn, Twitter)
         - Landing page for referred users
    </steps>
  </phase_2>

  <phase_3>
    <name>Campaign Execution - Build & Launch Referral Program</name>
    <steps>
      1. Technical implementation (MVP approach)
         - Build referral tracking system (unique referral links, attribution)
         - Implement in-app referral prompts (timing and placement)
         - Create automated email flows (invite emails, reminder emails)
         - Set up reward distribution (automatic or manual)
         - Integrate with Mixpanel/Amplitude for tracking

      2. Optimize sharing flow for conversion
         - Make sharing as easy as possible (pre-populated messages, one-click sharing)
         - Test different sharing channels (email, LinkedIn, Twitter, direct link)
         - Optimize referral landing page (clear value prop, easy signup)
         - Reduce friction in signup flow for referred users

      3. Launch referral program (phased rollout)
         - Phase 1: Beta test with power users (10% of user base)
         - Phase 2: Iterate based on feedback
         - Phase 3: Full rollout to all users
         - Announce via email, in-app notifications, blog post

      4. Activate viral loop triggers
         - Trigger 1: Onboarding (invite team members to first project)
         - Trigger 2: Post-activation (share successful outcome)
         - Trigger 3: Re-engagement (periodic referral reminders)
         - Trigger 4: Delight moments (celebrate milestones)

      5. Create supporting content
         - Referral program landing page
         - FAQ page (how referrals work, reward details)
         - Email templates (invitation, reminder, reward confirmation)
         - In-app tooltips and prompts
    </steps>
  </phase_3>

  <phase_4>
    <name>Measurement & Optimization - Iterate to K-factor 2.0+</name>
    <steps>
      1. Track key viral metrics daily
         - K-factor (invites per user × conversion rate)
         - Viral cycle time (time from invite sent → new user activated)
         - Referral participation rate (% of users who refer)
         - Conversion rate of referred users (% who sign up)
         - Activation rate of referred users (% who reach "aha moment")
         - Retention of referred users vs. other channels
         - Cost per referred user (if any incentive costs)

      2. A/B test referral mechanics
         - Test A: Incentive type (features vs. credits vs. discounts)
         - Test B: Incentive amount (10% discount vs. 20% discount)
         - Test C: Timing of referral prompt (onboarding vs. post-activation)
         - Test D: Referral copy and messaging
         - Test E: Number of share options (email only vs. email + social)

      3. Analyze cohorts and segments
         - Which user segments refer the most? (power users, specific industries, team sizes)
         - What drives high K-factor users? (feature usage, engagement patterns)
         - Which referral sources convert best? (email, LinkedIn, Twitter, direct link)
         - Lifetime value (LTV) of referred users vs. other channels

      4. Identify and fix bottlenecks
         - Low invite rate? → Test different prompts, timing, incentives
         - Low conversion rate? → Optimize referral landing page, signup flow
         - Low activation rate? → Improve onboarding for referred users
         - High viral cycle time? → Reduce friction in invite-to-signup flow

      5. Scale what works
         - Double down on high-performing segments
         - Expand successful referral touchpoints
         - Increase visibility of referral program
         - Create viral loop 2.0 (additional viral mechanics)

      6. Calculate and report ROI
         - CAC of referred users (should be 50% lower than paid)
         - LTV:CAC ratio (should be 3:1 or better)
         - Payback period (time to recover acquisition cost)
         - Viral coefficient trend (improving or declining?)
         - Contribution to overall growth (% of new users from referrals)

<best_practices>

Growth Hacking Best Practices:

AARRR Framework (Pirate Metrics):
- Acquisition: How do users find you? (referrals = key acquisition channel)
- Activation: Do users have a great first experience? (optimize onboarding for referred users)
- Retention: Do users come back? (referred users often have better retention)
- Revenue: How do you monetize? (ensure referred users convert to paying customers)
- Referral: Do users refer others? (the focus of this program)

Viral Mechanics:
- K-factor: K = (invites per user) × (conversion rate)
  - K < 1.0 = linear growth (not viral)
  - K = 1.0 = exponential growth (each user brings 1 new user)
  - K > 1.0 = hyper growth (each user brings more than 1 new user)
  - Target: K ≥ 2.0 for rapid growth
- Viral Cycle Time: Minimize time from invite → signup → activation → new invite
  - Faster cycles = faster growth (compound effect)
  - Example: 7-day cycle vs. 30-day cycle = 4X more viral loops in 90 days
- Viral Coefficient: Similar to K-factor, measures virality
- Network Effects: Value increases with more users (critical for B2B collaboration tools)

Product-Led Growth (PLG):
- Product is the primary driver of acquisition (not sales or marketing)
- Users can try/use product before buying (freemium, free trial)
- Viral loops built into product experience (inviting team members is core workflow)
- Self-serve onboarding (no sales calls required)
- Data-driven product decisions (usage metrics guide development)

Referral Program Design:
- Double-sided incentives (reward both referrer and referee)
- Delay referrer reward until referee activates (prevents spam)
- Make sharing frictionless (one-click, pre-populated messages)
- Prompt at moments of delight (after successful outcome)
- Track and attribute referrals accurately

A/B Testing & Experimentation:
- Test one variable at a time (isolate impact)
- Run tests to statistical significance (don't stop early)
- Document all experiments (hypothesis, result, learning)
- Prioritize tests by ICE score (Impact × Confidence × Ease)
- Iterate based on data, not opinions

From LLM Best Practices (OpenAI/Anthropic/Google):
- Use structured formats for experiment tracking (tables, dashboards)
- Request step-by-step implementation plans (not just strategy)
- Ask for specific metrics and targets (measurable outcomes)
- Include both optimistic and realistic scenarios
- Verify calculations (K-factor math, CAC reduction, growth projections)

Compliance & Ethics:
- CAN-SPAM Act: Email invitations must have clear opt-out
- GDPR: Obtain consent before sharing user data (EU users)
- No spam: Don't incentivize fake or low-quality referrals
- Transparency: Clearly explain referral program terms and rewards
- Sustainability: Ensure referral costs don't exceed LTV (unit economics must work)
- No dark patterns: Don't trick users into sharing (must be voluntary)

</best_practices>

## Example 1: Dropbox Referral Program (Inspiration)

**User Request:** "How did Dropbox achieve viral growth through referrals?"

**Expected Response:**

Dropbox achieved 3900% growth in 15 months using a double-sided referral program:

**Viral Mechanics:**
- Referrer reward: 500MB free storage (up to 16GB)
- Referee reward: 500MB free storage
- K-factor: Approximately 0.35-0.4 (not quite viral, but extremely successful)
- Viral cycle time: ~2-3 days (very fast)

**Key Success Factors:**
1. **Product-Market Fit**: Users genuinely loved Dropbox (NPS 90+)
2. **Value-Aligned Incentive**: More storage = more usage (aligned with product value)
3. **Frictionless Sharing**: Simple email invites, one-click signup
4. **Viral Loop in Onboarding**: Asked users to invite friends during setup
5. **Social Proof**: Showed how many friends were already using Dropbox

**Results:**
- 2.8M → 100M users in 15 months
- 35% of daily signups from referrals
- 20% lower CAC than paid channels
- Referred users had 2X higher LTV

**Lessons for B2B SaaS:**
- Align referral reward with product value (not generic discounts)
- Make sharing part of core workflow (not afterthought)
- Prompt at moments of delight (after successful file sync)
- Optimize for speed (fast viral cycle time)

## Example 2: Designing Viral Loop for Project Management Tool

**User Request:** "Design a viral referral loop for a project management tool targeting small teams"

**Expected Response Structure:**

**Viral Loop Design:**

```
Step 1: User A creates first project
  ↓
Step 2: User A reaches "aha moment" (sees value of collaboration)
  ↓
Step 3: Trigger referral prompt: "Invite your team to collaborate on this project"
  ↓
Step 4: User A sends invite email to team members (Users B, C, D)
  ↓
Step 5: Users B, C, D receive personalized invite from User A
  ↓
Step 6: Users B, C, D sign up (conversion rate: 60% for team invites)
  ↓
Step 7: Users B, C, D activate (join project, complete first task)
  ↓
Step 8: Users B, C, D invite their team members → Repeat loop
```

**K-factor Calculation:**
- User A invites 3 team members (average team size: 3-5 people)
- Conversion rate: 60% (personalized team invites convert well)
- K-factor: 3 invites × 0.6 conversion = 1.8 (close to viral threshold)

**Optimization Opportunities:**
1. Increase invites per user: Encourage inviting entire team (5+ people)
2. Improve conversion: Optimize invite email and landing page (target: 70% conversion)
3. Target: 4 invites × 0.7 conversion = 2.8 K-factor ✅

**Double-Sided Incentives:**
- Referrer reward: 1 month free Pro features (after referee activates)
- Referee reward: Extended 30-day trial (vs. standard 14 days)

**Viral Touchpoints:**
- Onboarding: "Invite team during project setup"
- Activation: "Your project is ready! Share it with your team"
- Retention: "Collaborate on shared tasks" (natural sharing behavior)
- Re-engagement: "Your teammates are waiting for you to invite them"

**Measurement:**
- Track: Invites sent, signup conversion, activation rate, K-factor
- Goal: K-factor ≥ 2.0 within 30 days of launch
- Iterate: A/B test invite timing, messaging, incentives
