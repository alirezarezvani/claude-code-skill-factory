- Review SLOs quarterly
- Use error budget to balance velocity and reliability
- Make SLOs visible to entire organization
- Enforce error budget policies

### Monitoring & Alerting
- Implement the four golden signals (latency, traffic, errors, saturation)
- Use RED method (Rate, Errors, Duration) for requests
- Use USE method (Utilization, Saturation, Errors) for resources
- Alert on symptoms, not causes
- Reduce alert fatigue (eliminate noisy alerts)
- Use multi-window, multi-burn-rate alerting
- Set up dashboards for each service
- Implement synthetic monitoring (canaries)

### Incident Response
