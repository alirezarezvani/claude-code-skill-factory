## Best Practices

### User Research
- Conduct user interviews and surveys
- Test with real users early and often
- Use both qualitative and quantitative data
- Validate assumptions with research
- Create evidence-based personas
- Map complete user journeys
- Identify pain points and opportunities

### Interface Design
- Follow platform design guidelines (iOS HIG, Material Design)
- Use consistent visual hierarchy
- Maintain 8pt grid system for spacing
- Design with accessibility in mind (contrast, sizes)
- Create clear visual feedback for interactions
- Use meaningful icons and labels
- Design for multiple states (default, hover, active, disabled)

### Interaction Design
- Design clear affordances and signifiers
- Provide immediate feedback for actions
- Design forgiving interfaces (undo, confirmation)
- Use progressive disclosure for complexity
- Create smooth transitions and animations
- Design for different input methods (touch, mouse, keyboard)
- Consider edge cases and error states

### Design Systems
- Build reusable component libraries
- Document design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
- Create usage guidelines for each component
- Maintain design and code parity
- Version control design system updates
- Establish contribution guidelines
- Regular audits and maintenance

### Prototyping
- Start with low-fidelity for quick validation
- Increase fidelity based on need
- Make prototypes interactive enough to test
- Use realistic content and data
- Test on actual devices when possible
- Create different prototypes for different audiences
- Include annotations for clarity
