## Actions Completed

### 1. Prompt Suite Consolidation ✅
**Problem:** 6 separate enhancement summary files fragmenting version history

**Files Deleted:**
- `MVP_COMPLETE.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `ENHANCEMENT_V2_SUMMARY.md`
- `ENHANCEMENT_V3_SUMMARY.md`
- `SCOPE_CONTROL_UPDATE.md`
- `MANDATORY_QUESTIONS_FIX.md`

**Replacement Created:**
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Comprehensive version history (v1.0 → v3.1)

**Result:** 6 files → 1 file (83% reduction), zero information loss

---

### 2. Master Prompt Engineer Cleanup ✅
**Problem:** 2 duplicate guide files at root level

**Files Deleted:**
- `PROMPT-ENGINEER-SKILL-GUIDE.md`
- `PROMPT-ENGINEERING-MASTER-GUIDE.md`

**Justification:** Each skill folder contains complete SKILL.md - duplicates removed

**Result:** Eliminated confusion, users reference skill folders directly

---

### 3. Documentation Structure Validation ✅

**Root Directory:**
- ✅ Only allowed files: README.md, CLAUDE.md, claude-skills-instructions.md, claude-agents-instructions.md
- ✅ No unauthorized .md files
- ✅ All living documents current and accurate

**Generated Skills:**
- ✅ All 9 skills have proper SKILL.md files
- ✅ All skills have HOW_TO_USE.md documentation
- ✅ Consistent structure across all skills
- ✅ No orphaned or misplaced files
