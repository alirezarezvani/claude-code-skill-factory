## 🔒 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### How to Report

**DO NOT** open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

**Instead**:
1. **Email**: Create a GitHub Security Advisory (preferred)
   - Go to: Repository → Security → Advisories → New draft security advisory
   - Or email: [Your security contact email]

2. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

3. **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 48 hours

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### 1. Secrets Management

**Secrets Are Never Committed**:
- ✅ All credentials use GitHub Secrets vault
- ✅ No hardcoded API keys or tokens
- ✅ .env files are gitignored
- ✅ Regular security audits performed

**Secrets Used in Workflows**:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Auto-provided by GitHub (minimal permissions)
- `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` - Claude Code authentication (scoped)
- `PROJECTS_TOKEN` - Project board access (scoped: repo + project only)

**Audit Status**: ✅ Last audited October 28, 2025 - No exposed credentials ([See Audit](.github/SECURITY_AUDIT.md))

---

### 2. Healthcare Data Protection

**For health-sdk-builder and healthcare applications**:

**Compliance Frameworks**:
- ✅ **HIPAA** (US) - Privacy Rule, Security Rule, Breach Notification
- ✅ **GDPR** (EU) - Articles 5-11, Data Subject Rights
- ✅ **DSGVO** (Germany) - German-specific requirements
- ✅ **PTV 10** (Germany) - Psychotherapy standards

**Data Protection**:
- ✅ Encryption at rest (AES-256)
- ✅ Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+)
- ✅ Audit logging (all PHI/PII access)
- ✅ Access controls (role-based)
- ✅ Data minimization
- ✅ Retention policies
- ✅ Right to erasure

**Clinical Safety**:
- ✅ Crisis detection (suicide, self-harm, harm to others)
- ✅ Emergency escalation workflows
- ✅ Mandatory reporting compliance
- ✅ Professional boundaries
- ✅ Evidence-based practices only

**Documentation**: See [HEALTHCARE_COMPLIANCE_GUIDE.md](generated-skills/claude-health-sdk-builder/compliance/HEALTHCARE_COMPLIANCE_GUIDE.md)

### 3. GitHub Workflows Security

**4-Layer Security Model**:

**Layer 1: GitHub Permissions**
```yaml
# Only team members can trigger workflows
if: contains(fromJSON('["OWNER", "MEMBER", "COLLABORATOR"]'),
             github.event.comment.author_association)
```

**Layer 2: Tool Restrictions**
```yaml
# Allowlist specific commands only
claude_args: '--allowed-tools "Bash(gh issue:*),Bash(gh pr:*)"'
# Blocks: git push, rm -rf, curl, wget, etc.
```

**Layer 3: Token Scoping**
- GITHUB_TOKEN: Minimal permissions (read by default)
- PROJECTS_TOKEN: repo + project only (no admin)
- CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN: Claude operations only

**Layer 4: Branch Protection**
- Required pull request workflow
- Status checks required (claude-review)
- No force pushes allowed
- Admin enforcement
- Conversation resolution required

---

### 4. Emergency Controls

**Kill Switch** (`.github/WORKFLOW_KILLSWITCH`):
- Master OFF switch for all workflows
- Current status: DISABLED (from Oct 24 incident)
- Instant shutdown capability (no code changes needed)

**Emergency Cleanup** (`.github/EMERGENCY_CLEANUP.sh`):
- Bulk issue closure for spam cleanup
- Dry-run mode for safety
- Documented procedures

**Emergency Procedures**: See [.github/GITHUB_WORKFLOWS_GUIDE.md](.github/GITHUB_WORKFLOWS_GUIDE.md#emergency-procedures)

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

**Never Commit**:
- ❌ API keys (sk-ant-*, any provider)
- ❌ GitHub tokens (ghp_*, github_pat_*)
- ❌ OAuth tokens
- ❌ Passwords or credentials
- ❌ .env files with secrets
- ❌ Private keys (.key, .pem files)
- ❌ Patient data (PHI/PII)

**Always Use**:
- ✅ .env.example templates (no real values)
- ✅ GitHub Secrets for CI/CD
- ✅ .gitignore for sensitive files
- ✅ Placeholder values in examples

---

### For Healthcare Applications

**Patient Data Protection**:
- ✅ Never commit patient data
- ✅ Use anonymized examples only
- ✅ Implement encryption (AES-256 minimum)
- ✅ Audit all data access
- ✅ Comply with HIPAA/GDPR/DSGVO

**Generated Applications**:
- ✅ Include compliance by default
- ✅ Document security requirements
- ✅ Provide encryption examples
- ✅ Include audit logging
- ✅ Add crisis detection (mental health apps)

---

### For Skill Development

**Safe Skill Creation**:
- ✅ No secrets in SKILL.md files
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in Python files
- ✅ Use environment variables for configuration
- ✅ Document security requirements
- ✅ Include security best practices in generated code

**Testing**:
- ✅ Use test API keys (rotated after testing)
- ✅ Never commit test credentials
- ✅ Use separate testing repository
- ✅ Clean up after testing

---

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### 1. Code Execution Tool

**What**: Skills can execute Python code (Code Execution Tool required)
**Risk**: Malicious skills could execute harmful code
**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Only use trusted skills (from this repository or verified sources)
- ✅ Review skill code before importing
- ✅ Code Execution runs in sandboxed environment (Anthropic-managed)
- ✅ No filesystem access outside sandbox

**Recommendation**: Review SKILL.md and Python files before importing unknown skills

---

### 2. Workflow Automation

**What**: GitHub workflows can modify issues, PRs, project boards
**Risk**: Malicious workflow changes could spam or delete content
**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Kill switch for emergency shutdown
- ✅ Branch protection (workflow changes require PR + review)
- ✅ Tool allowlists (restrict dangerous commands)
- ✅ Permission scoping (minimal required)
- ✅ Team-only access (@claude mentions)

**Recommendation**: Never merge workflow changes without review

---

### 3. Healthcare Applications

**What**: Generated apps handle sensitive patient data (PHI/PII)
**Risk**: Data breach, compliance violations, patient harm
**Mitigation**:
- ✅ HIPAA/GDPR/DSGVO compliance built-in
- ✅ Encryption templates provided
- ✅ Audit logging examples included
- ✅ Crisis detection for mental health apps
- ✅ Clear disclaimers (not replacement for professional care)

**Recommendation**:
- Clinical validation required before patient use
- Legal review for compliance
- Professional oversight mandatory
