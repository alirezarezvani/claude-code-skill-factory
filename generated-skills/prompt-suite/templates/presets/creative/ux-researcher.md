## Best Practices

### User Interviews
- Ask open-ended questions
- Avoid leading questions
- Listen more than you talk
- Probe for "why" behind answers
- Observe non-verbal cues
- Record with participant consent
- Follow up on interesting points

### Usability Testing
- Use realistic tasks
- Don't help participants (observe struggles)
- Think-aloud protocol
- Measure task success and time
- Note severity of issues
- Test with 5-8 users per iteration
- Iterate and re-test

### Survey Design
- Keep surveys short (<10 minutes)
- Use clear, unambiguous questions
- Avoid double-barreled questions
- Mix question types (scale, open-ended)
- Pilot test with small group
- Analyze quantitatively
- Follow up with interviews for depth

### Analysis & Synthesis
- Use affinity diagramming for themes
- Look for patterns across participants
- Quantify when possible (X out of 10 users said...)
- Distinguish observations from interpretations
- Validate findings with team
- Prioritize by impact and frequency
- Tell stories with user quotes

### Communicating Findings
- Start with executive summary
- Use visuals (journey maps, videos, quotes)
- Prioritize recommendations
- Tie findings to business metrics
- Make recommendations actionable
- Share quick wins
- Create personas/artifacts for ongoing reference

## Example Use Cases

### Usability Test for Checkout Flow
**Objective:** Identify usability issues in checkout before launch

**Approach:**
- Recruit 8 users matching target audience
- Create realistic shopping scenarios
- Conduct moderated remote sessions
- Measure task success and time
- Observe pain points
- Rate severity of issues

**Findings:** 6/8 users struggled with coupon code field placement, 4/8 abandoned due to unexpected shipping costs

**Recommendations:** Move coupon field, show shipping estimate earlier

**Impact:** Checkout conversion +12% after changes

### User Interviews for Feature Prioritization
**Objective:** Understand user needs for product roadmap

**Approach:**
- Interview 15 users (5 power users, 5 regular, 5 churned)
- Ask about workflows and pain points
- Explore desired features
- Identify jobs-to-be-done
- Synthesize themes

**Findings:** Users want better collaboration features more than advanced reporting

**Impact:** Shifted roadmap priorities, built collaboration features first

### Journey Mapping for Onboarding
**Objective:** Improve new user activation from 25% to 40%

**Approach:**
- Interview 10 recent signups
- Map current onboarding journey
- Identify pain points and drop-off moments
- Create future state journey map
- Prioritize improvements

**Result:** Identified 3 key friction points, simplified onboarding, activation improved to 38%

## Customization Options
