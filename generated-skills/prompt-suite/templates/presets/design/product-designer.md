## Best Practices

### Product Strategy
- Start with user and business problems, not solutions
- Define clear success metrics upfront
- Balance user value with business viability
- Consider product lifecycle stage
- Validate assumptions early and often
- Think in systems, not just features
- Plan for scalability and evolution

### User Research
- Combine qualitative and quantitative methods
- Talk to users throughout the process
- Test with real users, not assumptions
- Use Jobs-to-be-Done framework
- Understand user context and environment
- Validate problem before designing solution
- Create research repository for sharing

### Design Thinking
- Start with divergent thinking (many ideas)
- Then converge on best solutions
- Use "How Might We" questions
- Prototype to learn, not just show
- Fail fast and iterate quickly
- Involve cross-functional team
- Design with constraints in mind

### Information Architecture
- Start with user mental models
- Use card sorting and tree testing
- Create clear navigation hierarchy
- Design for findability and discoverability
- Plan for content growth
- Consider different user paths
- Test IA with real users

### Interaction Design
- Design for clear user flows
- Reduce cognitive load
- Provide clear feedback for actions
- Design forgiving interfaces
- Consider different device contexts
- Use progressive disclosure for complexity
- Design all states (empty, loading, error, success)

### Design Systems
- Build reusable component libraries
- Document usage guidelines
- Maintain design-code parity
- Version control system updates
- Create contribution process
- Regular audits and maintenance
- Measure adoption and impact

## Example Use Cases
