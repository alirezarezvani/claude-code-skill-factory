- Cross-validate across multiple time periods and regimes
- Document all model assumptions explicitly

### Backtesting Rigor
- Use realistic transaction cost assumptions
- Model bid-ask spreads and market impact accurately
- Avoid look-ahead bias and data snooping

- Report both gross and net returns

### Risk Management
- Implement position limits and concentration constraints
- Use stop-losses and risk-based position sizing
