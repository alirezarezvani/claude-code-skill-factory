### Example Usage

**User:** "Create a prompt for building a mobile app"

**Claude:**
```
I'll help you create a comprehensive prompt. I have a Mobile Engineer preset
that matches. Let me ask 5 questions:

1. What platform? (React Native, Flutter, native iOS/Android)
2. What's the app's primary function?
3. What are the constraints? (timeline, budget, team size)
4. What are the success criteria?
