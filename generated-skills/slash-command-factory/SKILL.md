## Two Paths to Generate Commands

### Path 1: Quick-Start Presets (30 seconds)

Choose from 10 powerful preset commands:

**Business & Research**:
1. **/research-business** - Comprehensive market research and competitive analysis
2. **/research-content** - Multi-platform content trend analysis and SEO strategy

**Healthcare & Compliance**:
3. **/medical-translate** - Translate medical terminology to 8th-10th grade (German/English)
4. **/compliance-audit** - HIPAA/GDPR/DSGVO compliance validation

**Development & Integration**:
5. **/api-build** - Generate complete API integration code with tests
6. **/test-auto** - Auto-generate comprehensive test suites

**Documentation & Knowledge**:
7. **/docs-generate** - Automated documentation creation
8. **/knowledge-mine** - Extract and structure insights from documents

**Workflow & Productivity**:
9. **/workflow-analyze** - Analyze and optimize business processes
10. **/batch-agents** - Launch and coordinate multiple agents for complex tasks

### Path 2: Custom Command (5-7 Questions)

Create a completely custom command for your specific needs.

---

## Question Flow (Custom Path)

### Question 1: Command Purpose

"What should this slash command do?

Be specific about its purpose and when you'll use it.

Examples:
- 'Analyze customer feedback and generate actionable insights'
- 'Generate HIPAA-compliant API documentation'
- 'Research market trends and create content strategy'
- 'Extract key insights from research papers'

Your command's purpose: ___"

---

### Question 2: Arguments (Auto-Determined)

The skill automatically determines if your command needs arguments based on the purpose.

**If arguments are needed**, they will use `$ARGUMENTS` format:
- User types: `/your-command argument1 argument2`
- Command receives: `$ARGUMENTS` = "argument1 argument2"

**Examples**:
- `/research-business "Tesla" "EV market"` → $ARGUMENTS = "Tesla EV market"
- `/medical-translate "Myokardinfarkt" "de"` → $ARGUMENTS = "Myokardinfarkt de"

**No user input needed** - skill decides intelligently.

---

### Question 3: Which Tools?

"Which Claude Code tools should this command use?

Available tools:
- **Read** - Read files
- **Write** - Create files
- **Edit** - Modify files
- **Bash** - Execute shell commands
- **Grep** - Search code
- **Glob** - Find files by pattern
- **Task** - Launch agents

Examples:
- Research command: Read, Bash (for web research)
- Code generator: Read, Write, Edit
- Analysis command: Read, Grep, Task (launch agents)

Your tools (comma-separated): ___"

---

### Question 4: Agent Integration

"Does this command need to launch agents for specialized tasks?

Examples of when to use agents:
- Complex analysis (launch rr-architect, rr-security)
- Implementation tasks (launch rr-frontend, rr-backend)
- Quality checks (launch rr-qa, rr-test-runner)

Options:
1. **No agents** - Command handles everything itself
2. **Launch agents** - Delegate to specialized agents

Your choice (1 or 2): ___"

If "2", ask: "Which agents should it launch? ___"

---

### Question 5: Output Type

"What type of output should this command produce?

1. **Analysis** - Research report, insights, recommendations
2. **Files** - Generated code, documentation, configs
3. **Action** - Execute tasks, run workflows, deploy
4. **Report** - Structured report with findings and next steps

Your choice (1, 2, 3, or 4): ___"

---

### Question 6: Model Preference (Optional)

1. **Default** - Inherit from main conversation (recommended)
2. **Sonnet** - Best for complex tasks
3. **Haiku** - Fastest, cheapest (for simple commands)
4. **Opus** - Maximum capability (for critical tasks)

Your choice (1, 2, 3, or 4) or press Enter for default: ___"

---

### Question 7: Additional Features (Optional)

"Any special features?

Optional features:
- **Bash execution** - Run shell commands and include output (!`command`)
- **File references** - Include file contents (@file.txt)
- **Context gathering** - Read project files for context

Features you need (comma-separated) or press Enter to skip: ___"

---
```

2. **Generate Command Body**:
```markdown
[Purpose-specific instructions]

[If uses agents]:
1. **Launch [agent-name]** with [specific task]
2. Coordinate workflow
3. Validate results

[If uses bash]:
- Context: !`bash command`

[If uses file refs]:
- Review: @file.txt

Success Criteria: [Based on output type]
```

3. **Create Folder Structure**:
```
generated-commands/[command-name]/
├── [command-name].md    # Command file (ROOT)
├── README.md            # Installation guide (ROOT)
├── TEST_EXAMPLES.md     # Testing examples (ROOT)
└── [folders if needed]  # standards/, examples/, scripts/
```

4. **Validate Format**:

# Command Instructions

Do [task] with "$ARGUMENTS":

1. **Step 1**: First action
2. **Step 2**: Second action
3. **Step 3**: Generate output

**Success Criteria**:
- Criterion 1
- Criterion 2
- Criterion 3
```

---

## Validation

Every generated command is automatically validated for:
- ✅ Valid YAML frontmatter (proper syntax, required fields)
- ✅ Correct argument format ($ARGUMENTS, not $1 $2 $3)
- ✅ allowed-tools syntax (comma-separated string)
- ✅ Clean folder organization (if folders used)
- ✅ No placeholder text

**If validation fails**, you'll get specific fix instructions.

---

## Best Practices

**For Command Design**:
- Keep commands focused (one clear purpose)
- Use descriptive names (kebab-case for files)
- Document expected arguments clearly
- Include success criteria
- Add examples in TEST_EXAMPLES.md

**For Tool Selection**:
- Read: For analyzing files
- Write/Edit: For generating/modifying files
- Bash: For system commands, web research
- Task: For launching agents
- Grep/Glob: For searching code

**For Agent Integration**:
- Use Task tool to launch agents
- Specify which agents clearly
- Coordinate outputs
- Document agent roles

---

## Important Notes

**Arguments**:
- ✅ Always use `$ARGUMENTS` (all arguments as one string)
- ❌ Never use `$1`, `$2`, `$3` (positional - not used by this factory)

**Folder Organization**:
- ✅ All .md files in command root directory
- ✅ Supporting folders separate (standards/, examples/, scripts/)
- ✅ No mixing of different types

**Output Location**:
- Commands generate to: `./generated-commands/[command-name]/`
- User copies to: `.claude/commands/[command-name].md` (when ready)
