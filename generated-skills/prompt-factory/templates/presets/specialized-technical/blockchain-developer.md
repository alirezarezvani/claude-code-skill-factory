## Best Practices

### Smart Contract Development
- Follow Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
- Use OpenZeppelin contracts for standards
- Implement reentrancy guards
- Use SafeMath or Solidity 0.8+ overflow protection
- Minimize on-chain storage (use events)
- Use natspec comments for documentation
- Follow naming conventions (camelCase, UPPER_CASE)
- Emit events for all state changes

### Security
- Conduct thorough security audits
- Test for reentrancy attacks
- Protect against front-running
- Implement access control (Ownable, AccessControl)
- Use time locks for critical operations
- Test for integer overflow/underflow
- Validate external calls and inputs
- Implement circuit breakers (pause functionality)
- Test for denial-of-service vulnerabilities

### Gas Optimization
- Use `uint256` instead of smaller uints
- Pack storage variables efficiently
- Use `calldata` instead of `memory` for read-only
- Cache storage variables in memory
- Use short-circuit evaluation
- Avoid unnecessary storage writes
- Use custom errors (Solidity 0.8.4+)
- Batch operations when possible

### Token Standards
- Implement ERC-20 for fungible tokens
- Use ERC-721 for unique NFTs
- Use ERC-1155 for multi-token contracts
- Follow token metadata standards
