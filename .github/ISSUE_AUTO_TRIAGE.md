# Issue Auto-Triage System

## Overview

The **Issue Auto-Triage** system uses Claude AI to automatically analyze, categorize, and prioritize GitHub issues within seconds of creation. This provides instant, consistent, and intelligent issue management without manual effort.

**Status**: ‚úÖ Active
**Workflow**: [issue-triage.yml](workflows/issue-triage.yml)
**Trigger**: Automatically on every new issue

---

## üéØ What It Does

When a new issue is created, Claude automatically:

1. **Analyzes** the issue title and description
2. **Classifies** the issue type (bug, feature, documentation, etc.)
3. **Assigns** priority level (P0-P3) with justification
4. **Evaluates** clarity and completeness
5. **Suggests** appropriate labels
6. **Identifies** affected repository components
7. **Searches** for related/duplicate issues
8. **Recommends** next actions
9. **Applies** labels automatically
10. **Posts** comprehensive triage analysis as comment

**Timeline**: ~30-60 seconds from issue creation to complete triage

## üìä Classification Framework

### Issue Types

| Label | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **bug** | Something isn't working correctly | Skill fails to load, script error, broken link |
| **feature** | New capability request | Add new skill type, support new format |
| **documentation** | Docs improvements | README updates, examples needed, clarifications |
| **question** | User needs help | How do I use X? What does Y mean? |
| **enhancement** | Improve existing functionality | Make skill faster, better error handling |
| **skill-request** | Request for new skill example | Need skill for X domain, Y use case |
| **agent-request** | Request for new agent example | Need agent for Z role, W task |
| **template-improvement** | Improve generation templates | Better prompts, more presets, validation |

### Priority Levels

| Priority | Description | Response Time | Examples |
|----------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **P0** | **Critical** - Blocks all users | Immediate | Security vulnerability, data loss, complete breakage |
| **P1** | **High** - Major functionality broken | Same day | Key skill fails, workflow broken for many users |
| **P2** | **Medium** - Important but has workaround | 2-7 days | Feature missing, moderate bugs, documentation gaps |
| **P3** | **Low** - Nice to have, minimal impact | When capacity allows | Cosmetic issues, minor enhancements, suggestions |

### Clarity Score (1-5 ‚≠ê)

- **‚≠ê** - Extremely vague, unusable
- **‚≠ê‚≠ê** - Missing critical information
- **‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê** - Acceptable but needs clarification
- **‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê** - Good, mostly complete
- **‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê** - Excellent, immediately actionable

### Actionability Status

- **Yes** - Can be worked on immediately
- **Needs Info** - Requires additional context from author
- **Blocked** - Depends on other issues or decisions

## üè∑Ô∏è Label System

### Automatic Label Application

Claude automatically applies labels based on high-confidence analysis:

- **Always applied**: Primary issue type (bug/feature/documentation/etc.)
- **Always applied**: Priority level (P0/P1/P2/P3)
- **Conditionally applied**: Component labels (skills/agents/templates/workflows)
- **Conditionally applied**: Status labels (needs-info/duplicate)

### Available Labels

**Type Labels**:
- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `documentation` - Docs improvements
- `question` - Help needed
- `enhancement` - Improve existing
- `skill-request` - New skill wanted
- `agent-request` - New agent wanted
- `template-improvement` - Template enhancements

**Priority Labels**:
- `P0` - Critical (immediate response)
- `P1` - High (same day)
- `P2` - Medium (2-7 days)
- `P3` - Low (when capacity allows)

**Status Labels**:
- `needs-info` - Missing information
- `duplicate` - Already exists
- `wontfix` - Not addressing
- `good-first-issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help-wanted` - Community help welcome

**Component Labels**:
- `skills` - Affects skill examples
- `agents` - Affects agent examples
- `templates` - Affects generation templates
- `workflows` - Affects GitHub workflows
- `docs` - Affects documentation

## üîç Intelligence Features

### Duplicate Detection

Claude automatically searches for similar issues:
```bash
gh issue list --search "keywords from title and body"
```

If potential duplicates found:
- Links them in the triage comment
- Suggests closing as duplicate if confidence high
- Asks author to confirm relationship

### Related Issue Discovery

Claude identifies related issues even if not duplicates:
- Issues mentioning same components
- Issues with similar symptoms
- Issues by same author on related topics

### Context Awareness

Claude understands repository structure:
- References [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) for standards
- Knows about skill examples in `claude-skills-examples/`
- Knows about generated skills in `generated-skills/`
- Understands template structure in `documentation/templates/`

## üß™ Testing

### Test Auto-Triage

Create a test issue to verify the system:

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "Test Issue: Verify Auto-Triage System" \
  --body "This is a test issue to verify that Claude automatically:

  1. Analyzes the issue within 60 seconds
  2. Posts a comprehensive triage comment
  3. Applies appropriate labels
  4. Identifies this as a test/question

  Expected: Should be labeled as 'question' with P3 priority."
```

**Expected results** (within 60 seconds):
1. ‚úÖ Workflow triggers: `.github/workflows/issue-triage.yml`
2. ‚úÖ Comment posted with full analysis
3. ‚úÖ Labels applied: `question`, `P3`
4. ‚úÖ Triage complete

### Verify Workflow Runs

Check triage workflow status:
```bash
# View recent runs
gh run list --workflow=issue-triage.yml --limit 5

# View specific run details
gh run view <run-id> --log
```

### Monitor Performance

Track triage timing:
```bash
# List issues with their creation and first comment time
gh issue list --json number,title,createdAt,comments --jq '.[] | {
  number: .number,
  title: .title,
  created: .createdAt,
  first_comment: .comments[0].createdAt,
  triage_time: ((.comments[0].createdAt | fromdateiso8601) - (.createdAt | fromdateiso8601))
}'
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue Not Triaged

**Symptom**: New issue created but no triage comment appears

**Possible causes**:
1. **Workflow hasn't run yet** - Check workflow runs:
   ```bash
   gh run list --workflow=issue-triage.yml --limit 1
   ```

2. **OIDC authentication failed** - Check run logs for token errors:
   ```bash
   gh run view <run-id> --log | grep -i "oidc\|token"
   ```

3. **Permissions insufficient** - Verify workflow has `issues: write`

4. **Concurrency conflict** - Check if another triage is running

### Workflow Fails

**Common errors**:

**Error**: "gh: command not found"
- **Cause**: GitHub CLI not available in runner
- **Fix**: Workflow uses `ubuntu-latest` which includes `gh` by default

**Error**: "403 Forbidden"
- **Cause**: Insufficient permissions
- **Fix**: Add `issues: write` to workflow permissions

**Error**: "OIDC token failed"
- **Cause**: Missing `id-token: write` permission
- **Fix**: Already included in workflow permissions

### Labels Not Applied

**Symptom**: Triage comment posted but labels not applied

**Possible causes**:
1. **Labels don't exist** - Create missing labels in repository settings
2. **Label names mismatch** - Check exact spelling in workflow prompt
3. **Command syntax error** - Verify `gh issue edit` command in Claude's response

**Fix**: Manually apply labels or re-run workflow

### Duplicate/Similar Issues Not Detected

**Symptom**: Claude doesn't find related issues that exist

**Cause**: Search keywords not matching existing issues

**Improvement**: Add more search variations in prompt:
```yaml
# Search with multiple keyword combinations
gh issue list --search "keyword1 OR keyword2 OR keyword3"
```

## üìä Metrics & Insights

### Track Triage Performance

**Average triage time**:
```bash
# Calculate average triage time from last 20 issues
gh issue list --limit 20 --json number,comments --jq '[.[] | select(.comments | length > 0)] | map((.comments[0].createdAt | fromdateiso8601) - (.createdAt | fromdateiso8601)) | add / length'
```

**Triage accuracy** (manual verification):
- Review 10 random triaged issues
- Confirm type classification matches reality
- Verify priority is appropriate
- Check if labels are accurate

**Label distribution**:
```bash
# Count issues by label
gh issue list --json labels --jq '[.[] | .labels[].name] | group_by(.) | map({label: .[0], count: length}) | sort_by(.count) | reverse'
```

### Success Criteria

A healthy auto-triage system shows:
- ‚úÖ 95%+ of issues triaged within 60 seconds
- ‚úÖ 90%+ type classification accuracy
- ‚úÖ 85%+ priority assignment accepted without change
- ‚úÖ 80%+ duplicate detection rate
- ‚úÖ <5% workflow failures
