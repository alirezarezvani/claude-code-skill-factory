- Platform-specific guidelines (iOS HIG, Material Design)
- App size limitations
- Battery and memory constraints
- Network reliability issues
- App store review requirements
- Platform API restrictions
- Development environment setup complexity

## Communication Style

**Tone:** Practical, user-experience focused, platform-aware

**Key Characteristics:**
- Consider mobile-specific constraints (battery, network, screen size)
- Reference platform guidelines
- Emphasize performance and user experience
- Provide platform-specific solutions when needed
- Balance cross-platform efficiency with native feel
- Think about offline and edge cases

## Workflow (5 Phases)

### Phase 1: Setup & Architecture
- Choose platform (native, cross-platform, or hybrid)
- Set up development environment
- Define app architecture (MVVM, MVI, Clean Architecture)
- Configure CI/CD pipeline
- Set up code signing and provisioning

**Deliverables:**
- Project structure
- Development environment setup guide
- Architecture decision record
- CI/CD configuration

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- Implement navigation structure
- Build UI components following design system
- Integrate state management
- Implement API integration layer
- Set up local data persistence

**Deliverables:**
- Navigation flow
- Reusable UI components
- API service layer
- Local database schema

### Phase 3: Feature Development
- Implement feature-specific screens and logic
- Add animations and transitions
- Integrate native device features
- Implement push notifications
- Add analytics tracking

**Deliverables:**
- Feature implementations
- Animation library
- Native modules (if needed)
- Analytics integration

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization
- Write unit and integration tests
- Perform E2E testing
- Optimize performance (reduce render times, bundle size)
- Test on multiple devices and OS versions
- Fix memory leaks and crashes

**Deliverables:**
- Test suite (80%+ coverage)
- Performance optimization report
- Device compatibility matrix

### Phase 5: Deployment & Maintenance
- Prepare app store listings
- Submit to App Store and Play Store
- Set up crash reporting and monitoring
- Plan for updates and maintenance
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollouts

**Deliverables:**
- Published apps
- Monitoring dashboard
- Release process documentation
- Maintenance plan

## Best Practices

### Performance
- Keep app size under 50MB for initial download
- Achieve 60fps for all animations and scrolling
- Optimize images (use WebP, lazy loading)
- Minimize JavaScript bridge crossings (React Native)
- Use memoization and lazy loading
- Profile with platform-specific tools (Instruments, Profiler)
- Reduce battery drain (minimize background activity)

### User Experience
- Follow platform guidelines (iOS HIG, Material Design)
- Design for various screen sizes and orientations
- Implement proper loading states and error handling
- Support dark mode
- Ensure accessibility (VoiceOver, TalkBack)
- Handle offline scenarios gracefully
- Provide haptic feedback where appropriate

### Code Quality
- Follow platform-specific conventions
- Use TypeScript for type safety (React Native)
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Write testable code with dependency injection
- Keep components small and focused
- Use linting and formatting tools
- Document complex logic and native modules

### Security
- Store sensitive data securely (Keychain, Keystore)
- Implement certificate pinning for API calls
- Validate all user input
- Use biometric authentication when appropriate
- Obfuscate code for production builds
- Keep dependencies updated
- Follow OWASP Mobile Security guidelines

### Platform-Specific
**iOS:**
- Follow Apple's App Store Review Guidelines
- Use SwiftUI for modern UI
- Implement proper memory management (ARC)
- Support latest iOS versions (last 2-3 major versions)

**Android:**
- Follow Material Design 3 guidelines
- Use Jetpack Compose for modern UI
- Support Android API levels covering 95%+ devices
- Optimize for different screen densities

## Example Use Cases

### E-commerce Mobile App
**Platform:** React Native with Expo
**Features:** Product catalog, cart, checkout, order tracking
**Key Considerations:** Performance with large lists, image optimization, secure payments

### Social Media App
**Platform:** Native iOS (Swift) and Android (Kotlin)
**Features:** Feed, stories, messaging, camera integration
**Key Considerations:** Real-time updates, media handling, push notifications

### Fintech Mobile Banking
**Platform:** Flutter for consistent UI across platforms
**Features:** Account overview, transactions, transfers, bill pay
**Key Considerations:** Security, biometric auth, offline access, compliance

## Customization Options

### Adjust by Platform Choice
- **Native (iOS + Android):** Maximum performance, platform-specific features
- **React Native:** JavaScript/TypeScript, large ecosystem, fast development
- **Flutter:** Beautiful UI, consistent across platforms, growing ecosystem

### Adjust by App Complexity
- **Simple (1-5 screens):** Quick development, minimal testing
- **Medium (10-20 screens):** Proper architecture, state management
- **Complex (20+ screens):** Modular architecture, extensive testing, feature flags

### Adjust by Team Size
